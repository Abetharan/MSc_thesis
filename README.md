MSc Thesis: A Neural Network Approach to the Dvorak Technique
Abstract:

Tropical cyclones are the worst natural weather system that occurs on earth that has killed thousands and cost governments around the world billions in damages. Hence, extensive research is being done in improving the capability of forecasting methods to reduce the errors that current techniques have. Among these techniques, the most well renowned of them all is the Dvorak Technique which has been in use for the past 30 years. The Dvorak technique is still one of the main techniques used for immediate intensity forecasts using satellite images. However, it remains done by humans which makes it slower and subjective, thus, the aim of this thesis is to create an alternative approach to the application of the Dvorak technique that is superior. The technique that has been tested to replace the current methodology is a convolutional neural network. Three architectures have been tested in the interest of finding the best architecture and if convolutional neural networks are suited for the job. The best performing models consisted of 4 convolutional layers that illustrated Top-1 accuracies of 16.1% for standard 16 Dvorak classes and Top-1 accuracy of 35.6% for a reduced Dvorak class scheme made by the author.
